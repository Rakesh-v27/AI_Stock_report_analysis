It is thanks to their hard work, week \\nafter week, that we continue to grow, all the while maintaining the great prices, high-\\nquality products, and friendly service that keep our customers coming back, again and \\nagain. \\n \\n“In 2021, we set our sights on doubling sales by 2026 and having a significantly bigger \\nbusiness over the longer term. Three years into this five-year plan, sales are on track \\nand we continue to be confident in the growth opportunity in front of us. The brand is \\nin better shape than ever, with a material opportunity to continue growing and \\ndeveloping the Greggs estate and plenty of scope to continue to grow in newer \\ndayparts and channels.” \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\n \\nENQUIRIES: \\nGreggs plc \\nRoisin Currie, Chief Executive \\nRichard Hutton, Chief Financial Officer \\nDavid Watson, Head of IR \\nTel: 0191 281 7721 \\n \\nHudson Sandler \\nWendy Baker / Hattie Dreyfus / \\nNick Moore / Emily Brooker \\nEmail: greggs@hudsonsandler.com \\nTel: 020 7796 4133 \\n \\nAn audio webcast of the analysts’ presentation will be available to download later today at \\nhttp://corporate.greggs.co.uk/ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n4 \\n \\nChair’s statement \\n \\nI’m delighted with the further progress that Greggs has made in 2024. The whole team \\nhas demonstrated its ability to execute on our strategic plan, responding to market \\nconditions whilst continuing to deliver another year of progress and attractive returns.  \\nWe are excited by the opportunity ahead and investing to realise that potential.  In doing \\nso we remain true to the responsible, long-term approach that has served this business \\nand its stakeholders well for many years. \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nGreggs delivered another strong performance in 2024, making further progress against our \\nstrategic plan and delivering an excellent financial outcome in more challenging market \\nconditions. The long-term growth opportunity ahead is clear and we are making good progress \\nas we develop capacity in our supply chain to support further expansion in the years ahead. \\n \\nThe Board’s agenda for the year reflected the Company’s ambitious growth plans.  We \\ncontinued to review the health of the brand and management’s initiatives to develop the food \\nand drink offer and improve access to Greggs across multiple channels. The Board scrutinised \\nthe investment plans that support these objectives, ensuring that the business is making good \\nreturns on the expansion of its shop estate into areas where Greggs has not traditionally been \\naccessible.  This gives us confidence as we lay down capacity for the next phase of expansion. \\n \\nHigh standards of governance have long been associated with Greggs, and we work hard to \\nensure that these are maintained as the operating environment changes.  During the year the \\nBoard received updates on key risk areas and put a particular focus on processes for allergen \\nmanagement, given the material risk associated with this.   \\n \\nThe business remains in a strong financial position and in 2024 the Board oversaw the \\nrefinancing of its revolving credit facility, as well as supporting the defined benefit pension \\nscheme Trustee to de-risk the Company’s legacy pension scheme through the purchase of an \\ninsurance policy which matches the majority of the scheme’s liabilities. \\n \\nGreggs has always aimed to carry out its business in a responsible manner and our pursuit of \\nthe targets that make up The Greggs Pledge has really pushed us forward on this agenda.  As \\nwe enter the final year of our current Pledge targets, great progress has been made in making \\nGreggs an even more sustainable business and we are now refreshing the priorities for the \\nnext phase of this journey.  In supporting the communities in which Greggs operates we often \\npartner with The Greggs Foundation, the independent charity set up by Ian Gregg almost 40 \\nyears ago.  The Foundation makes a significant and positive impact on those who need its \\nhelp and I would like to thank our colleagues, customers and partners for their support with \\nthis important work. \\n \\nOur people and values \\n \\nOur colleagues across the business are remarkable people, and critical to the reputation that \\nGreggs has for fast and friendly service.  The Board takes time to stay close to them in order \\nto get first-hand feedback on what’s working and what could be done better.  It’s a credit to \\nthe open culture of the business that they do not hold back in offering their views and I want \\nto thank them for this and for their continued dedication. \\n \\nThis ‘listening’ activity involves Directors visiting shops, supply sites and support teams, as \\nwell as attendance at forums that help us to hear the impact of our plans on colleagues.  This \\nmakes the Board better equipped to question and support management and to make informed \\ndecisions. \\n \\nThe Board \\n \\n\\n \\n5 \\n \\nOn 1st June 2024 we welcomed Tamara Rogers as an additional Non-Executive Director.  \\nTamara is the Global Chief Marketing Officer of Haleon plc, the FTSE100 listed world-leading \\nconsumer healthcare company, and has over 30 years’ experience across a range of \\ncommercial and marketing roles.  She brings a wealth of experience across marketing, \\ncustomer insight, and digital commerce. \\n \\nThe Board engaged in an externally-facilitated review in the year.  This comprehensive review \\nprocess included the facilitator’s attendance at meetings, including all of our Committees, to \\nsee the Board in action.  Interviews also extended to the Company’s Operating Board \\nmembers to evaluate the manner in which the Board interacts with the executive team.  The \\nprocess was extremely worthwhile and led to some valuable learnings that will help us to \\nimprove further, but I am pleased to say that the overwhelming outcome was that this is a \\nhighly effective and engaged board. \\n \\nFurther details of the Board’s work are included in the Governance and Committee sections \\nof the Annual Report and Accounts 2024. \\n \\nDividend \\n \\nAt the time of the interim results in July 2024 the Board declared an interim ordinary dividend \\nof 19.0 pence per share (2023: 16.0 pence per share). In line with our progressive ordinary \\ndividend policy and our target for the ordinary dividend to be twice covered by earnings, the \\nBoard intends to recommend at the AGM a final dividend of 50.0 pence per share (2023: 46.0 \\npence per share), giving a total ordinary dividend for the year of 69.0 pence per share (2023: \\n62.0 pence per share). \\n \\nOur capital allocation policy, as outlined in the Financial Review, details our approach to \\ndistribution, and the methodology for determining and returning any surplus cash to \\nshareholders. In May 2024, in application of this policy, the Board paid a special dividend of \\n40.0 pence per share. \\n \\nLooking ahead \\n \\nGreggs made strong progress in 2024 and demonstrated its ability to respond to tighter market \\nconditions in the second half of the year.  This, and the Company’s robust financial health, \\nputs us in a good position to deliver our plans for long-term profitable growth, whilst navigating \\nnear-term developments in market conditions.  The Board remains confident in the Greggs \\nbusiness and our future plans. \\n \\n \\nMatt Davies \\nChair \\n4 March 2025 \\n \\n\\n \\n6 \\n \\nChief Executive’s report \\n \\n2024 was another record-breaking year for Greggs; we exceeded £2 billion in sales for \\nthe first time and opened our 2,600th shop. Our people have worked tirelessly to deliver \\non our strategic ambition to further establish Greggs as a multi-channel food-to-go \\nretailer and I want to acknowledge their efforts. It is thanks to their hard work, week \\nafter week, that we continue to grow, all the while maintaining the great prices, high-\\nquality products, and friendly service that keep our customers coming back, again and \\nagain. \\n \\nIn 2021, we set our sights on doubling sales by 2026 and having a significantly bigger \\nbusiness over the longer term. Three years into this five-year plan, sales are on track \\nand we continue to be confident in the growth opportunity in front of us. The brand is \\nin better shape than ever, with a material opportunity to continue growing and \\ndeveloping the Greggs estate and plenty of scope to continue to grow in newer \\ndayparts and channels. We continue to lay the foundations for this growth opportunity \\nby investing in our manufacturing and logistics capacity. We have commenced building \\nwork on two large new sites in the Midlands, a frozen product manufacturing and \\nlogistics facility in Derby and a chilled and ambient National Distribution Centre in \\nKettering, building additional capacity which will allow us to service up to 3,500 shops. \\n \\nThe growth strategy that we began implementing in 2021 has proven hugely successful and \\nwe remain committed to pursuing our four key drivers of growth: broadening customer appeal; \\nincreasing and developing our estate; extending evening trade; and using digital channels to \\nexpand our home delivery offer and Click + Collect – all underpinned by significant investment \\nin our supply chain and technology. Our assessment of the opportunity to grow to an estate of \\nsignificantly more than 3,000 shops remains unchanged, and we see further opportunity to \\ngain increased market share in the evening daypart and delivery channel, whilst also \\nmaximising the value of the customers who now use our App. \\n \\nIn 2024, our like-for-like sales in company-managed shops were up 5.5% year-on-year despite \\nthe food-to-go market being challenging, with no volume growth in the market overall. We \\nmaintained our overall share of the market and retained our position as the UK’s No.1 brand \\nfor food-to-go breakfast (Source: Circana CREST, YE December 2024), helping to start the \\nday well for millions. \\n \\nAs we attract new customers and increase sales, it is imperative we invest in our infrastructure \\n– both physical and digital – to keep pace. We aim to simplify operations, improve efficiencies, \\nand use data and technology to drive better decisions and reduce complexity for our people. \\n \\nA key part of this is the evolution of our supply chain operating model. In 2016, we began to \\nmove away from a traditional regional bakery model – where every site made every product – \\ntowards a consolidated, centralised approach. Today, our nine production facilities are \\nmanufacturing centres of excellence, specialising in specific products and producing them at \\nscale. \\n \\nOur plans for further growth will require additional capacity in our supply chain over the coming \\nyears.  During 2024, we introduced a fourth savoury line at our Balliol Park site in Newcastle \\nupon Tyne, increasing production capacity for savoury rolls and bakes by circa 35%, and \\ncompleted work on expanding our regional distribution centres in Amesbury and Birmingham \\nproviding 300 additional shops of logistics capacity. We also set in motion two major new \\ndevelopment projects: a new frozen manufacturing and logistics facility in Derby (due to open \\nin 2026) and a new National Distribution Centre in Kettering (due to open in the first half of \\n2027). Both sites are designed to support our Radial Distribution Centres and will significantly \\nincrease our logistics capacity; when both are operational we will be able to service an \\nadditional 700 shops through the automated upstream picking of frozen, chilled and ambient \\ngoods, taking our total logistics capacity to 3,500 shops. \\n \\n\\n \\n7 \\n \\nHaving led this significant transformation project since 2012, our Supply Chain Director, Gavin \\nKirk, has now retired. He handed over to Kuldip Bains who has joined Greggs from Bakkavor \\nGroup plc where he was responsible for operational excellence across their 15 manufacturing \\nsites and four distribution sites. I wish to thank Gavin for leaving our supply chain \\ntransformation project in such a strong position, ready for Kuldip to maximise the significant \\ngrowth and efficiency opportunities ahead. \\n \\nI would also like to thank Jonathan Jowett who is retiring after 15 years’ service to Greggs as \\nour Company Secretary & General Counsel. He played a key role in Greggs growth from \\nbakery to multi-channel food-to-go retailer, ensuring we have a robust governance structure \\nin place. He hands over to Sarah Dickson, former Deputy General Counsel and Data \\nProtection Officer at Marks and Spencer and, prior to that, senior director for regulatory \\ncompliance at ASDA. \\n \\nAs we forge ahead into 2025, I know we have the right senior team in place to take our \\nbusiness from strength to strength. We have established strong foundations for future growth, \\nand I look forward to another year of solid progress towards our goals. \\n \\nFinancial results  \\n \\nTotal sales grew to £2,014 million in 2024 (2023: £1,810 million), an 11.3% increase on the \\nlevel seen in 2023. Within this, company-managed shop like-for-like sales were 5.5% higher \\nthan 2023.  \\n \\nUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year increased by 13.2% to £189.8 million (2023: \\n£167.7million). For further detail, see the Financial Review. Including exceptional gains, pre-\\ntax profit for the year increased to £203.9 million (2023: £188.3 million). \\n \\nOur key drivers of growth \\n \\nBroadening customer appeal  \\nOur mission is to provide our customers with excellent value for money, great quality food, \\nand fast and friendly service. To ensure that we are as accessible as possible, we continue to \\nextend opening hours, increase the reach of home delivery, and open shops in more locations. \\nThrough new product development, our loyalty programme on the Greggs App, and engaging, \\nrelevant communications, we continue to reach new customers and deepen our relationship \\nwith our existing ones. \\n \\nDuring 2024, we further evolved our range, allowing us to meet our customers’ needs and \\ndesires through all channels and in every daypart. We rolled out our popular over-ice drinks \\nrange following a successful trial, now available in 1,175 shops, along with chilled ‘Ready-to-\\nDrink’ Latte and Caramel Latte canned products.  We extended our Healthier Choices menu \\nwith new pasta dishes and Chicken Pesto and Spicy Mexican Bean Flatbreads. Our hot food \\nmenu is proving increasingly popular, with pizza deals driving strong growth, and we \\nconducted successful trials of made-to-order options during the lunch and evening dayparts. \\nOur new add-on product, Mozzarella & Cheddar Bites, won the ‘New Food To Go Award’ at \\nthe 2024 ‘Sammies’ (The Sandwich & Food To Go Industry Awards). \\n \\nWe rotate our product range across the year to provide enticing novelty, with customers \\nenjoying the return of seasonal stalwarts, such as the Festive Bake and Vegan Festive Bake, \\nas well as new twists on old favourites. Popular new seasonal products in 2024 included the \\nCherry Bakewell Muffin, Spicy Vegetable Curry Bake, Pumpkin Spice Doughnut, Gingerbread \\nLatte, Christmas Lunch Baguette, and Festive Flatbread.  \\n \\nAccording to Brand Finance’s latest ranking, Greggs is now the UK’s second-strongest brand \\n(UK 250 2024) with a triple-A rating. This is derived from high scores for value for money, \\nconsideration and familiarity, and demonstrates that we are deeply rooted in customers’ minds \\n\\n \\n8 \\n \\n– a key advantage in the food-to-go market, where success is driven by being front of mind \\nwhen customers are seeking food-on-the-go.  \\n \\nThe popularity of the Greggs brand allows us to cut through in fun, entertaining and engaging \\nways, celebrating British culture in our trademark tongue-in-cheek way. As a value-driven \\nbrand, generating media coverage in this way is a key part of our customer engagement \\nstrategy and, in 2024, we made notable appearances at Vicky Pattison’s wedding, Olly Murs’ \\nbaby shower, and at the beach in Whitley Bay, Tyneside, where Rosie Ramsey helped to \\nlaunch our Fish Finger Sandwich. After the huge success of the Greggs Bistro in Fenwick \\nNewcastle in 2023, we returned in 2024 with the pop-up Greggs Champagne Bar, pairing \\ncustomers’ favourite bakes and rolls with a curated selection of champagnes. \\n \\nDuring London Fashion Week in September, we launched ‘Baked in Gold’, a limited-edition \\ncollection of 22-carat gold-plated jewellery featuring Sausage Roll earrings, a Jammy Heart \\nNecklace and even a Greggs charm bracelet. The range of 1,000 items – the first from a food-\\nto-go retailer – was designed and hand-crafted by contemporary British artist Dion Kitson and \\nsold out within an hour of its launch. \\n \\nEvery year we look for new, innovative, and fun ways to celebrate the return of our much-\\nanticipated Christmas menu. This year, we recruited Nigella Lawson to star in our Christmas \\nadvert, letting the nation know that even the most sophisticated of palates revel in the \\n‘rapturous riot of flavour’ that is our Festive Bake. \\n \\nGrowing and developing the Greggs estate  \\nExpanding our national network of shops is central to our growth plans. In 2021, we launched \\nour five-year growth plan, outlining our ambition to reach significantly more than 3,000 shops \\nin the UK in the longer term. In November 2024, we opened our 2,600th shop, marking a \\nsignificant milestone in our estate expansion strategy.  \\n \\nOver the course of the year, we opened an average of four new shops every week and, on \\n28th December 2024, had 2,618 Greggs shops across the UK (2023: 2,473). In total, we \\nopened a record 226 new shops (2023: 220) and closed 81 shops (28 closures and 53 \\nrelocations), resulting in 145 net new shop openings. \\n \\nWe opened six shops in Northern Ireland, taking the total in this region to 23. This is a \\ndeveloping market for Greggs where we see potential for further growth and we have a strong \\nnew shop pipeline in place for the year ahead. \\n \\nIn addition to finding new sites, relocating existing shops is a key part of our strategy to grow \\nthe Greggs estate. During 2024, we closed shops in 53 locations to make way for a better one \\neither nearby or by expanding into a vacant unit next door, allowing us to serve more \\ncustomers and expand our offer in that community. Relocating shops enables us to retain the \\nexisting shop team whilst adding the space needed to reach more customers. This might be \\nby providing seating, housing new equipment to expand our range into hot products or iced \\ndrinks or installing an assembly station to better meet the needs of Click + Collect customers \\nand delivery couriers. In these locations in the heart of communities, our customer base is \\nalready well established and further investment unlocks swift, profitable growth.  Relocated \\nshops see a circa 30% increase in sales on average in the year after the change of location \\nwhich, consistent with our treatment of all new shops, are excluded from our like-for-like sales \\ngrowth measure until they have completed one full calendar year of trading. \\n \\nAs an example, we first opened a shop on London’s Cheapside in 2012 and it quickly became \\na success. However, both the size and shape of the property were a constraint to growth. We \\nwanted to add channels to improve sales and began to look for another space. Fortuitously, \\nthe unit next door became available, enabling us to create a larger shop with ample seating \\nand a significant upgrade to the customer area.  \\n \\n\\n \\n9 \\n \\nSimilarly, we conducted an extensive programme of refits; refurbishing, reconfiguring or \\nextending 125 company-managed shops and 40 franchised shops to make them more modern \\nand appealing, as well as better set up to support our multi-channel offer. \\n \\nWe continue to focus on broadening our presence beyond the high street and almost half of \\nour shops (48.5%) are now in alternative locations such as petrol forecourts, roadsides, \\ntransport hubs, retail parks, supermarkets, universities and hospitals. Ten years ago, these \\nlocations represented just 18.1% of the Greggs estate.  As well as offering a strong return on \\nour investment, these are the locations where we see the greatest potential for future growth. \\nDuring 2024, 144 of the 226 new shops we opened were away from the high street, including \\n11 standalone drive-thrus, and 11 shops inside large supermarkets. Notable openings in travel \\nhubs included three in Glasgow (Queen Street, Central and Motherwell railway stations), \\nEmbankment London Underground station, a second shop at London Bridge station, and \\nBlackpool Tram Station. Securing transport locations means we can place a shop inside a \\nclosed catchment, ensuring customers in those locations have more choice when they grab \\ntheir breakfast, lunch or dinner whilst on the move. \\n \\nGreggs is a trusted brand offering a strong covenant to landlords and franchise partners and \\nthis continues to generate opportunities in new locations. Our new shop pipeline is strong, and \\nwe remain confident that we will deliver between 140 and 150 net openings again in 2025. We \\nwill continue our dual strategy of growing our high street presence by relocating shops and \\nrefitting existing ones, as well as opening new shops where Greggs continues to be \\nunderrepresented, such as retail parks, railway stations, airports, roadsides and \\nsupermarkets.   \\n \\nExtending evening trade  \\nEvening sales now represent 9.0% of company-managed shop sales, up from 8.5% in 2023, \\nwith post-4pm trading again being the fastest growing daypart. \\n \\nWe know that relevant menu development is key to our success in the evenings. Our hot food \\nrange, in particular our Southern Fried Chicken Goujons and Southern Fried Potato Wedges, \\ncontinue to perform well after 4pm. In 2024 we launched a BBQ Chicken & Bacon pizza and \\ncomplemented the well-established six-slice pizza box with the introduction of a smaller four-\\nslice box. \\n \\nWe have also expanded our made-to-order offer. In 2024, we carried out a ‘made-to-order’ \\ntrial in ten shops in Newcastle upon Tyne and are now inviting people to customise orders for \\nfish finger wraps, fish finger sandwiches, chicken wraps, and chicken burgers at circa 140 \\nshops. Customers can choose from a variety of sauces, plus add-ons of bacon and cheese, \\nand enjoy it as part of a meal deal with wedges and a drink from £5. We plan to introduce \\nthese made-to-order options at a further 200 locations by the end of the first quarter of 2025. \\n \\nDuring the summer, we launched a CRM campaign called ‘Happier Days’, utilising the Greggs \\nApp to grow evening trade, offering double reward stamps on every purchase after 5pm from \\n8 July to 10 August. During this campaign we saw a strong uplift in evening like-for-like sales \\ncompared to other dayparts, and transactions remained higher following the campaign, \\nshowing the lasting effect of the promotion. \\n \\nOver the longer term, the ongoing evolution of our menu and the convenience and diversity of \\nour shop estate offers a significant opportunity to further increase our share of both the walk-\\nin and delivery evening markets. \\n \\nDeveloping digital channels \\nThe Greggs App, Click + Collect, and our partnerships with Just Eat and Uber Eats help drive \\nforward our ambition to become a multi-channel retailer. Whether a customer wants to visit a \\nshop, order in advance, or have food delivered to their home or workplace, we want their \\nexperience to be smooth, easy, and quick. \\n \\n\\n \\n10 \\n \\nUse of the award-winning Greggs App continues to grow, with customers scanning it in 20.1% \\nof transactions in company-managed shops during 2024 (2023: 12.5%). This notable growth \\nin the use of Greggs Rewards has been driven by the value the App offers; we reward \\ncustomers who collect nine stamps in a category by giving them their tenth item free. The App \\nalso allows us to promote products and flag new menu items, while allowing customers to find \\ntheir nearest Greggs and check opening times. We continue to focus on making sure it is easy \\nand intuitive to use and are pleased that it is rated 4.8 out of 5 on both Google Play Store and \\nApple’s App Store. We ended 2024 in the No.1 spot for free Food & Drink apps on both app \\nstores. \\n \\nEffective customer relationship management is key to unlocking further growth from the App \\nand, this year, we implemented a new customer engagement platform that is helping us to \\nunderstand our customers at a much more granular level, further enhancing our ability to \\nengage with them and increase loyalty. It has allowed us to use geo-targeting to identify top \\nApp users in a particular area to offer money-can’t-buy benefits, such as an invitation to a \\nsommelier event at the Fenwick Greggs Champagne bar. When we had special product \\nlaunches, such as for the Baked in Gold jewellery range or Greggs Top Trumps, we sent App \\nusers a link to our online shop before we posted it on social media. \\n \\nDuring 2024, we increased the number of shops offering home delivery to 1,556 (2023: 1,440). \\nCollectively, our customers placed circa 10 million orders through the Just Eat or Uber Eats \\napps over the year, with basket sizes on average more than double those of walk-in \\ncustomers. Sales through this channel were up 30.9% compared with 2023, and in 2024 \\ndelivery represented 6.7% of company-managed shop sales (2023: 5.6%). \\n  \\nBehind the scenes, we have been improving our operational procedures to fulfil demand and \\nmake the experience slicker for both customers and colleagues. This includes better menu \\nmanagement in our shops and streamlining the menu to make it easier for customers scrolling \\nonline. Next, we are focusing on providing our customers with more accurate estimations of \\ncourier arrival times. \\n \\nInvesting in our supply chain and technology for a bigger business  \\nAs our shop estate grows, we are expanding our manufacturing and logistics capability to \\nensure that our supply capacity can meet increased demand. \\n \\nIn early 2024, we finalised the commissioning of a fourth manufacturing line at our Balliol Park \\nsite in Newcastle, increasing levels of automation and boosting production capacity for our \\nsavoury rolls and bakes by 35%. \\n \\nWe also completed the redevelopment of our Amesbury and Birmingham distribution centres, \\ndoubling capacity at the former and streamlining operations at the latter. Together, these \\ninvestments in our logistics infrastructure mean that we are now set up to support an additional \\n300 shops. \\n \\nDuring the year, we signed agreements for two new state-of-the-art sites in the Midlands. The \\nfirst, at SmartParc in Derby, will be both a manufacturing and logistics facility, replicating the \\nsuccess of our northern frozen manufacturing and logistics campus at Balliol Park. In addition \\nto an automated cold store, the new site (due to open in 2026) will introduce automated picking \\nright down to the shop level.  \\n \\nThe second new site, in Symmetry Park, Kettering, will be a National Distribution Centre for \\nstoring, picking, and distributing ambient and chilled goods. In January 2025 we purchased a \\n25-acre plot and have begun building the facility, which we expect will be operational in 2027. \\nThe site will embrace increased levels of automation to enable upstream picking, relieving \\npressure on our Radial Distribution Centres. This allows us to increase throughput and \\nimprove the productivity of our entire logistics chain. \\n \\n\\n \\n11 \\n \\nTogether, these two new sites will allow us to support a total estate of up to 3,500 shops. In \\naddition, they are being purpose-built to include developable ‘white space’ that will allow us to \\nmake additional investments to support further growth, as required. The expected impact of \\nthese investments on the shape of margin and returns is set out in the Financial Review. \\n \\nIn addition to physical infrastructure, we are ensuring that we have the right technology and \\nsystems in place to maximise efficiency and minimise complexity right across our operations. \\nThis includes the implementation of new EPOS till software to improve how we manage pricing \\nand promotions. We also began the project to transition to an updated Enterprise Resource \\nPlanning software system, SAP S4HANA, which brings greater AI and analytics capability to \\nhelp streamline processes, improve productivity, and give us real-time insights. All these \\ninvestments are generating better data which we can use to adjust and improve how we do \\nthings. As our business becomes more complex, we will use AI and technology to make our \\npeople’s jobs as simple as possible, lightening the cognitive load and letting them get back to \\nwhat they do best: providing amazing service for our customers. \\n \\nAs our shops become ever more reliant on connectivity, we have invested in introducing full \\nfibre broadband at every shop where it is available. We are upgrading all our Chip & Pin \\ndevices to ensure that we are utilising the most efficient technology available. We are also \\ntesting new initiatives aimed at driving further sales growth and delivering efficiencies, for \\nexample in 2025 we will trial touchscreen kiosk ordering and remote temperature monitoring. \\n \\nLooking after our people  \\n \\nAs the employer of 33,000 people – many of whom work flexibly or part-time – we feel a \\nresponsibility to help improve their financial security. One way in which we do this, whilst also \\ndriving engagement, is through our longstanding profit share scheme. We continue to share \\n10% of our profits between colleagues who have been with us for six months or more, which \\nthis year will see qualifying colleagues share £20.5 million. \\n \\nOnce again, we have reviewed our pension contributions. Last year, we increased the \\nCompany’s matched contribution to 6% and, in the year ahead, will raise it again to 7%, helping \\nour people to save for their future. We continue to offer a colleague discount when buying \\nGreggs products, and provide a share save scheme that enables our people to purchase \\nGreggs shares at a discount. \\n \\nWe have reviewed our family-friendly policies and increased maternity and paternity pay. Our \\nintention is to support our people, whatever their stage of life, to make sure they can balance \\ntheir family commitments with their career aspirations. \\n \\nImproving the diversity of our workforce is one of the ten commitments of The Greggs Pledge, \\nand our ambition is that we reflect the communities we serve by the end of 2025. In September \\n2024, we held our first internal Inclusion Conference, during which we reflected on and \\ncelebrated the progress we have made in this important area. We now have three colleague \\ninclusion networks: REACH (our ethnicity group), ENABLE (our disability group) and PRIDE \\n(our LGBTQ+ group) that aim to support these communities and improve access to \\nopportunities. We recognise that we need to work harder to achieve greater ethnic diversity in \\nour management population and are actively encouraging colleagues from a minority \\nbackground to apply for our leadership development programmes.  \\n \\nGiving back  \\n \\nWith such a large workforce, our greatest contribution to society is providing fairly-paid, \\nsustainable jobs to tens of thousands of people across the country.  \\n \\nIn addition, we contribute 1% of our pre-tax profits to The Greggs Foundation (the \\n“Foundation”) which distributes it to communities through initiatives such as Breakfast Clubs, \\nhardship funds, and its community grant schemes. In 2024, we donated £3.1 million to the \\n\\n \\n12 \\n \\nFoundation - this includes donating 1% of our pre-tax profits, and a share of profits from our \\nOutlet shops. This was topped up by a further £1.1 million raised by our colleagues and \\ncustomers through in-shop donations, two Breakfast Club appeal weeks, colleague Give As \\nYou Earn donations and fundraising. We also donate 5p to the Greggs Foundation for every \\nJammy Heart Biscuit and children’s sandwich sold. \\n \\nWe have supported BBC Children in Need for 18 years now, raising over £13 million for them \\nin that time. 2024 was no exception and the collection buckets, merchandise and Pudsey \\nbiscuits in our shops during November raised over £1 million for the charity. \\n \\nWe also support Children’s Cancer North by funding the delivery of their Children’s Cancer \\nRun every May, putting collection buckets in our shops in the North East and Cumbria, and \\nencouraging customers to participate in the event. \\n \\nThe Greggs Pledge  \\n \\nSince launching The Greggs Pledge in 2021, the business has united around ten clear \\ncommitments, and we have driven progress in every area. As we enter the final year of this \\nphase of our journey we have now met or exceeded some of our original targets, and are on \\ntrack to meet most of the others, and I am very proud of what we have achieved together. \\n \\nEvery one of our colleagues can be part of The Greggs Pledge journey – and I know so many \\nof them feel very passionate about contributing to making Greggs a better business; it is a \\nsource of real pride and purpose. \\n \\nIn a fast-changing world, it is important that we regularly review our approach and, this year, \\nwe conducted a materiality assessment to ensure that our priorities are still the correct ones. \\nWe asked our people, suppliers and partners where we need to concentrate our efforts next, \\nand we are now collating that feedback ready to evolve our approach in 2026. \\n \\nWe group the ten commitments of The Greggs Pledge into three areas: Stronger, Healthier \\nCommunities; Safer Planet; and Better Business. Below are some highlights from the past \\nyear. \\n \\nStronger, healthier communities  \\nGreggs Foundation launched its first Breakfast Club in 1999 and, 25 years later, proudly \\ncelebrated the opening of its 1,000th club. These clubs provide a free and nutritious breakfast \\nto over 75,000 schoolchildren every day, helping to tackle hunger in some of the UK’s most \\ndeprived communities. \\n  \\nWe are delighted that the Government is proposing to introduce funded breakfast clubs for \\nprimary schools and are now looking at how our support for Greggs Foundation can extend \\nthe positive impact of breakfast clubs across more of the school day.   \\n \\nGreggs Foundation will be building on the long history of its Breakfast Clubs to add even \\ngreater value to the network of 1,000 schools. Now called Feeding Brighter Futures, The \\nGreggs Foundation’s schools programme will continue to incorporate Breakfast Clubs for as \\nlong as supported schools need them, as well as developing additional support through after-\\nschool clubs and holiday club provision. The Foundation gives schools the freedom and funds \\nto choose nutritious options and activities that will help children overcome barriers and provide \\nnew opportunities for learning. \\n \\nAnother way we tackle food insecurity is by redistributing our unsold food. Our ‘daily fresh’ \\napproach means that products that haven’t been sold by the end of the day are taken off our \\nshelves. We use several channels to redistribute unsold food: our Outlet shops; charity \\npartners; the Too Good To Go app; and colleague Magic Bags. We redistributed 45% of all \\nunsold food through these channels in 2024 (2023: 41.9% redistributed) and returned the \\n\\n \\n13 \\n \\nremainder to our manufacturing sites from where it was sent to an anaerobic digestion facility \\nthat composts the food and creates biogas. \\n \\nOur supply sites also have a longstanding partnership with FareShare and during 2024 we \\ndonated 50 tonnes of food which was then passed on to more than 1,500 charities across the \\nUK. We have given them around 420 tonnes of food during the entirety of our partnership \\nwhich, according to WRAP’s meals calculator, is equivalent to 1 million meals – a significant \\nmilestone. \\n \\nWe have also grown our network of Greggs Outlets to 38 shops, allowing us to sell day-old \\nproducts at a big discount in places of higher social deprivation. A portion of the profits from \\neach Outlet shop is then donated to community charities that support people in the local area. \\n \\nBuilding stronger, healthier communities is also about making sure that we are supporting our \\ncustomers to eat a healthier diet. During 2024, we again delivered on our commitment to \\nensure that at least 30% of our product range is a healthier option and expanded our range of \\nflatbreads, salads and fruit pots. \\n \\nSafer planet  \\nWe remain on track to becoming a Net Zero business by 2040, and to meeting our nearer-\\nterm goal of using 100% renewable energy by the end of 2025. Wherever we are responsible \\nfor sourcing the electricity, we choose to purchase 100% renewable electricity and, in a \\nrelatively small number of shops where our landlords don’t do the same, we are encouraging \\nthem to change. We have succeeded in moving 60% of the gas we use to renewable sources \\nand, over time, are switching away from gas towards electricity.  \\n \\nIn 2024, we converted one of our major distribution depots to allow us to power our vehicles \\non Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) instead of diesel. This allows us to drive approximately \\ntwo million miles each year using renewable fuel, circa 10% of the total miles our logistics fleet \\ndrives each year. \\n \\nWe test new environmentally-friendly technologies in our Eco-Shop in Northampton and those \\nthat work well and demonstrate impact are added to our standard shop fit-out. As a result, \\nover a quarter of our shop estate now features equipment that is helping us to save water, \\ncreate less waste, or use less energy. \\n \\nLooking ahead, our Scope 3 carbon footprint is the area where we see the largest opportunity \\nto reduce emissions. A significant number of our suppliers have now publicly declared a Net \\nZero target of their own and we are having constructive conversations with them to see what \\nwe can learn from each other, and how we might work in partnership to further reduce carbon \\nin our value chain. \\n \\nBetter business  \\nWe recognise that our people are crucial to our success, and we make sure that they are fairly \\nremunerated, given opportunities to progress, and treated well. We aim to offer inclusive \\nworkplaces and are striving to build diverse teams that better reflect the communities we \\nserve. \\n \\nBeing a better business also means using our buying power as a force for good. We have a \\nclear sustainable procurement vision: “To source and collaborate with suppliers to accelerate \\nThe Greggs Pledge to build strong, healthy communities, make the planet a safer place, and \\nbuild a better business.” This vision keeps human rights, animal welfare, and environmental \\nsustainability top of mind. \\n \\nDuring 2024, our procurement team has focused on improving the sustainability information \\nwe collect during our onboarding and tendering processes, and our growing capability to utilise \\nsustainability data such as EcoVadis assessments.  \\n \\n\\n \\n14 \\n \\nA forward look  \\n \\nLooking ahead to 2025, the macroeconomic landscape remains tough. Inflation remains \\nelevated, and many of our customers continue to worry about the cost of living. After years of \\nfinancial anxiety, they are still facing concerns about energy prices and increased mortgage \\nand rent costs. \\n \\nDespite a challenging food-to-go market, Greggs has demonstrated its ability to make positive \\nprogress and we remain confident that Greggs can and will continue to grow. The five-year \\nstrategic plan that we set out in 2021 is proving successful. We constantly adapt our plans to \\nmeet the evolving landscape, and we remain confident in the growth opportunity in front of us \\nthrough broadening our appeal, expanding our estate, extending into the evening daypart, and \\ndeveloping our digital offer – all underpinned by significant investment in our supply chain and \\ntechnology. \\n \\nIncreases in employment taxes will significantly increase our wage bill, and that of other \\nretailers, in 2025, but we have dealt with significant cost inflation effectively over recent years \\nand remain confident in our ability to manage the impact of cost inflation on the business. We \\nare relentlessly focused on improving efficiencies which supports our position as a value-led \\nbrand. To the extent that we cannot mitigate cost inflation through savings, we recover it \\nthrough careful pricing activity, which we strive to keep to an absolute minimum to ensure that \\nwe protect our reputation for offering great value. \\n \\nOur number one place in YouGov’s poll for the most popular Quick-Service Restaurant, Coffee \\nShop and Delivery Service brand and strong ratings for quality and value for money (YouGov \\nBrand Health, December 2024) leave us confident that we will continue to win in the food-to-\\ngo market.  \\n \\nCurrent trading and outlook  \\n \\nLike-for-like sales in company-managed shops have increased by 1.7% year-on-year in the \\nfirst nine weeks of 2025 with challenging weather conditions in January followed by improved \\ntrading in February. We have a strong pipeline of new shop openings ahead as we pursue our \\nambitious growth plans and invest in the supply chain capacity that supports this.  \\nManagement’s expectations for 2025 are unchanged and we are confident that Greggs can \\nmanage inflationary headwinds and deliver another year of progress in 2025. \\n \\nI remain optimistic about the many growth opportunities available to Greggs and have great \\nconfidence in our people’s ability to unlock them. \\n \\n \\nRoisin Currie \\nChief Executive \\n4 March 2025 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n15 \\n \\nFinancial review \\nGreggs delivered another good financial performance in 2024. Sales growth reflected a \\nrecord number of new shop openings as well as continued progress in developing new \\nchannels. The Company’s robust balance sheet supports our growth strategy as we \\ninvest in the capacity that will enable further growth and strong returns.   \\n \\n \\n2024  \\n£m  \\n2023  \\n£m  \\n \\n \\nVariance \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nRevenue \\n2,014.4 \\n \\n1,809.6  \\n+11.3% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nUnderlying operating profit \\n195.3 \\n \\n171.7  \\n+13.7% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nFinance income \\n8.1 \\n \\n6.1  \\n+32.8% \\nFinance expense \\n(13.6) \\n \\n(10.1)  \\n+34.7% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nUnderlying profit before tax \\n189.8 \\n \\n167.7  \\n+13.2% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nExceptional income \\n14.1 \\n \\n20.6  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nProfit before tax \\n203.9 \\n \\n188.3  \\n+8.3% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nIncome tax \\n(50.5) \\n \\n(45.8)  \\n+10.3% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nProfit after tax \\n153.4 \\n \\n142.5  \\n+7.6% \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nUnderlying diluted earnings per share \\n137.5p \\n \\n123.8p  \\n+11.1% \\nUnderlying return on capital employed \\n20.3% \\n \\n21.1%  \\n \\n \\n \\nSales \\n \\nTotal Group sales for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2024 grew by 11.3% to £2,014 million \\n(2023: £1,810 million). Growth was delivered through both new shop openings and like-for-\\nlike sales growth in existing shops, reflecting both volume growth and price increases. Total \\nGroup revenue reflects sales from company-managed shops, which include delivery sales, \\nand sales through the business-to-business channel to our franchise and grocery wholesale \\npartners. \\n \\nReporting ‘like-for-like’ sales (sales in company-managed shops with more than one calendar \\nyear’s trading history) is a key alternative performance measure for Greggs, as it shows \\nunderlying company-managed estate sales performance excluding the impact of new shop \\nopenings and closures. In 2024 like-for-like sales were 5.5% up on 2023. The pattern of like-\\nfor-like growth through the year reflected the annualisation of trading hours extension and the \\nroll out of delivery services with Uber Eats in Q4 2023, along with a generally-tougher market \\ncontext in the second half of the year. The challenging market context resulted in us not \\nachieving our 2024 target for like-for-like sales growth. \\n \\nThe performance of shops managed by franchise partners proved more resilient to market \\nconditions, being primarily focused on roadside locations.  Franchise like-for-like ‘system \\nsales’ (sales in franchised shops with more than one calendar year’s trading history) grew by \\n7.4% in 2024, reflecting growing consumer use of these locations and trading hours extension \\nto serve later dayparts. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n16 \\n \\nProfit for the year \\n \\nUnderlying operating profit (profit before finance income and expense, exceptional income \\nand tax) was £195.3 million in 2024 (2023: £171.7 million).  After financing costs and \\nexceptional income profit before taxation was £203.9 million in 2024 (2023: £188.3 million). \\nThe strong profit progression reflected overall sales growth supported by good cost control \\nand margin management. Profits included a net exceptional gain of £14.1 million which \\nprimarily relates to the sale of our legacy Twickenham supply chain site.  \\n \\nThe business experienced overall like-for-like cost inflation of around 4% in 2024. This was \\nprimarily driven by employment costs, with food and packaging costs marginally deflationary \\nfollowing the significant increases experienced in 2022 and 2023. Energy costs reduced year-\\non-year and our shop occupancy cost ratio (shop costs such as rent, rates and service charges \\nas a percentage of sales) was stable. \\n \\nLooking forward we currently expect overall input cost inflation in 2025 to be around six per \\ncent. Employment cost inflation will again be the biggest driver of higher costs, including the \\nimpact of the increase in the National Living Wage and an increase in employer’s National \\nInsurance contributions. We have good levels of forward cover for commodity costs, with \\nalmost 100% of our electricity requirements fixed for the year and forward purchase \\nagreements in place representing circa five months of our food and packaging needs.  \\n \\nOffering great value to customers is key to our strategic purpose, and we leverage our scale \\nand vertical integration to keep costs low. We have a rolling programme of cost-saving \\ninitiatives with the aim of mitigating as much cost pressure as possible, and in 2024 this \\ndelivered £10.6 million of savings. Through the programme we look to leverage the scale in \\nour manufacturing operations, completing end-to-end process reviews to realise the benefits \\nof our vertical integration. The strength of our financial covenant and our scale helps us secure \\nthe best procurement rates. We also target waste reduction, which aligns with our Greggs \\nPledge commitments. \\n \\nTo the extent that we cannot mitigate cost inflation through savings, we recover it through \\ncareful pricing activity, whilst ensuring that we protect our reputation for offering great value, \\ngreat quality products. We continually compare our prices with the market across a range of \\nproducts and ensure that our relative price proposition remains strong, with prices comparable \\nto the grocery sector, but for freshly-prepared food and drink, and at a strong discount \\ncompared to other food-to-go specialists. \\n \\nFollowing a period of margin investment to support the development of new channels and \\ndayparts we have focused on cost control and strong management of pricing and promotions \\nto improve profitability. This has resulted in an increased underlying operating profit margin of \\n9.7% in 2024 (2023: 9.5%). \\n \\nInvesting for growth \\n \\nWe continue to see good returns on new shop openings, including the relocation of existing \\nshops to better premises that enable them to reach their full potential.  The scope for further \\ngrowth in the estate is material and we have set out plans to create capacity in our supply \\nchain to service around 3,500 shops in the medium term, whilst also leaving open options to \\nextend this further. \\n \\nThis expansion in capacity relies on a number of key investment projects: \\n \\n• \\n Completed - the expansion of manufacturing capacity at Balliol Park in Newcastle, \\nwhere a fourth production line was commissioned in 2024, increasing capacity for \\nsavoury rolls and bakes by 35%. \\n\\n \\n17 \\n \\n• \\n Completed - extension and refurbishment works at our Amesbury and Birmingham \\nRadial Distribution Centres, completed in 2024, have added capacity to serve an \\nadditional 300 shops across the south of the UK. \\n• \\n In progress - our new site in Derby will manufacture and distribute frozen products, \\nbringing automated upstream picking to the Greggs supply chain for the first time. \\nThis will help our existing Radial Distribution Centres to support more shops from \\nmid-2026. \\n• \\n In progress - a new National Distribution Centre in Kettering will consolidate our \\nexisting operations there for chilled and ambient goods as well as supporting the \\nmove to upstream picking in 2027. \\n \\nThese investments collectively take the logistics capacity in our network to around 3,500 \\nshops. We have planned carefully for this phase of growth and are financing the investment \\nfrom a combination of cash deliberately carried into the programme, a long-term lease of the \\nbuilding at Derby and ongoing cash generation. The impact of stepping up our capacity in this \\nway will increase our capital employed and create additional fixed costs in the short-term, with \\nboth subsequently utilised as we expand our operations.   \\n \\nCapital employed will progressively build as the sites are developed and brought into use. The \\ncash retained to fund investment has been part of the capital employed in the business in \\nrecent years and will remain so as it is converted to fixed assets. In addition, the 25-year lease \\nof the building at Derby was capitalised in 2024 (with a right-of-use asset and liability value of \\n£47 million) ahead of being fitted out with cash-funded assets. We expect the cash-funded \\ncapital investment in the Derby site to be £135 million, including the cost of the first production \\nline. As the programme continues, the asset base will expand further, with capital employed \\ngrowing ahead of capacity utilisation through to 2027. \\n \\nOperating costs, primarily depreciation, will increase in steps as the new operations are \\nbrought into use. The shell of the Derby site was built in 2024, and work in 2025 will be focused \\non fitting out the site, installing the automated logistics operations and setting up the site’s first \\nproduction line. We are targeting a logistics ‘go live’ in the second quarter of 2026 and a \\nproduction ‘go live’ in the final quarter of 2026. The land for the Kettering site was purchased \\nin January 2025 at a total cost of £30 million and the focus for this coming year is to build the \\nshell of the building, before fitting this out through 2026. Commissioning at Kettering is due to \\ncommence in the final quarter of 2026, with the site expected to be fully operational in the \\nsecond half of 2027. We expect the cash-funded capital investment in the Kettering site to be \\na further £105 million following the land purchase. \\n \\nWhilst carrying cash forward into the current investment programme the business has \\nmaximised the opportunity to earn interest income on cash deposits. In 2024 this income \\ntotalled £8.1 million and will reduce in 2025 as cash levels normalise. \\n \\nWe plan to utilise the additional capacity created by this investment programme as the \\nbusiness grows its shop numbers in the years ahead. The expanded logistics network will \\nallow for around 900 further net new shops from the starting position in 2025, supporting six \\nto nine years’ worth of expansion at recent opening rates (100-150 net shops per annum). The \\nshort-term impact will be an increase in fixed costs and a temporary reduction in return on \\ncapital employed (ROCE). \\n \\nThe additional fixed costs associated with the Derby site are expected to present a circa 40 \\nbasis point headwind to operating margin in 2026. A similar additional margin headwind is \\nexpected in 2027 as these costs annualise and the Kettering site opens, though this \\nincremental cost will begin to be offset in that year as we continue to grow the shop estate and \\nstart to utilise the capacity created. We expect this trend to continue in the following years, to \\nthe further benefit of margin and returns. We continue to target a return to a ROCE of circa \\n20% in the medium term. \\n \\n \\nFinancing charges \\n\\n \\n18 \\n \\n \\nWe earned £8.1 million (2023: £6.1 million) of finance income on cash deposits during the \\nyear and incurred finance expenses of £13.6 million (2023: £10.1 million) which comprised \\n£13.0 million (2023: £9.6 million) in respect of the IFRS 16 interest charge on lease liabilities \\nand a net £0.6 million  (2023: £0.5 million) of facility charges under the Company’s (undrawn) \\nfinancing facilities, interest on the defined benefit pension liability and foreign exchange \\nlosses. \\n \\nTaxation \\n \\nThe Group has a simple corporate structure, carries out its business entirely in the UK and all \\ntaxes are paid here. We aim to act with integrity and transparency in respect of our taxation \\nobligations. \\n \\nThe Group’s overall effective tax rate on profit in 2024, including the impact of exceptional \\nitems, was 24.8% (2023: 24.3%).  The headline rate for the year was 25.0% (2023: 23.5%) \\nfollowing the increase from 19.0% to 25.0% in the corporation tax rate from 1 April 2023.  The \\noverall tax rate was lowered by the inclusion of the exceptional gain on disposal of the \\nTwickenham bakery site.    \\n \\nThe underlying tax rate for the year was 25.7% (2023: 24.4%) – the year-on-year movement \\nin the underlying rate is almost entirely due to the increase in the headline rate of tax.  \\n \\nWe expect the effective tax rate for 2025 to be around 26.0% and going forward the effective \\nrate is expected to remain around one percentage point above the headline corporation tax \\nrate.  This is principally explained by expenditure for which no tax relief is available, such as \\ndepreciation on properties acquired before the introduction of structures and buildings tax \\nallowances, and acquisition costs relating to new shops. \\n \\nEarnings per share and dividend \\n \\nUnderlying diluted earnings per share in 2024 was 137.5 pence (2023: 123.8 pence per \\nshare). Including the net exceptional income diluted earnings per share were 149.6 pence \\n(2023: 139.2 pence per share). \\n \\nThe Board recommends a final ordinary dividend of 50.0 pence per share (2023: 46.0 pence \\nper share). Together with the interim dividend of 19.0 pence (2023: 16.0 pence) paid in \\nOctober 2024, this makes a total ordinary dividend for the year of 69.0 pence per share (2023: \\n62.0 pence per share).  This is covered two times by underlying diluted earnings per share \\nand is in line with our progressive ordinary dividend policy, which aims to increase the dividend \\nin line with growth in underlying earnings per share. \\n \\nSubject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the final ordinary \\ndividend will be paid on 30th May 2025 to shareholders on the register at 2nd May 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n19 \\n \\nBalance sheet \\n \\nCapital expenditure \\n \\nIn line with our plans we invested a total of £249.0 million (2023: £199.8 million) in capital \\nexpenditure during 2024. Retail estate expenditure grew as we increased the number of \\ncompany-managed \\nshop \\nopenings \\nand \\nrelocations, \\nand \\ncompleted \\nmore \\nshop \\nrefurbishments. We also rolled out additional equipment to support sales growth, including ice \\nmachines to provide a new range of over-ice drinks to our customers. In our supply chain we \\ncompleted the commissioning of a fourth production line for our iconic savoury rolls and bakes \\nat Balliol Park in Newcastle and completed the works to extend logistics capacity at our \\nBirmingham and Amesbury distribution centres. In addition, we commenced the fit-out phase \\nof the new leased site in Derby, and made some deposit payments in respect of the new \\nKettering site. IT investment also increased as we began the work to upgrade our ERP system \\nto SAP S4HANA.   \\n \\nDepreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangibles in the year \\nwas £80.8 million (2023: £70.5 million). A further £59.2 million (2023 £54.5 million) of \\ndepreciation was charged in respect of right-of-use assets on capitalised leases. \\n \\nAs previously communicated, our capital investment will continue at an elevated level until \\n2026 as we build additional capacity in our supply chain to support our ambitious growth plans, \\nwhilst also growing and refurbishing our retail estate. In 2025 we will complete the work to \\nbring into use the logistics capabilities of our new site in Derby, and progress the construction \\nof our new site in Kettering having completed the purchase of the land in early January 2025. \\nWe expect the Derby site to be operational in 2026, with the Kettering site following in 2027. \\n \\nOur shop opening and relocation plans mean that we will invest in circa 160 new company-\\nmanaged shops in 2025 and refurbish around 120 existing company-managed shops as we \\nmodernise older sites and introduce additional facilities to support our growth plans. In our \\nretail estate we continue to target a 25% cash return on investment on new shops and typically \\nexceed this level after two to three years as shops mature. The focus of the acquisition strategy \\nmeans we are opening shops that trade longer hours and have higher than average sales and \\nreturns. The returns on newly-opened shops remain strong and, being mainly in new \\ncatchments, have not impacted on the sales of other shops in the estate. \\n \\nOverall we expect capital expenditure in 2025 to be around £300 million, with the delay in the \\npurchase of the land for Kettering altering the phasing of previous guidance. We anticipate \\nthat capital expenditure will be around £200 million in 2026 before returning to a normalised \\nlevel beyond this investment phase, where we expect maintenance capital expenditure to be \\nup to 5% of revenue, with additional expenditure deployed to support further growth as \\nrequired. \\n \\nWorking capital \\n \\nWe ended the year with Group net current liabilities of £67.3 million (2023 net current assets \\nof £25.4 million) as our cash and cash equivalents balance reduced as we progressed with \\nour capital investment plans. Stock and debtor levels increased primarily due to sales growth. \\nThe net current liabilities position reflects supplier funding as we receive payment from \\ncompany-managed shop customers ahead of paying suppliers on standard terms.   \\n \\nPension scheme \\n \\nDuring the year the Company made a special contribution of £4.5 million to its closed defined \\nbenefit pension scheme, which facilitated the purchase of a bulk annuity ‘buy-in’ policy with \\nAviva. This policy will provide regular payments to the scheme Trustee to fund future pension \\npayments and significantly reduces the Company’s exposure to the funding risks associated \\nwith its defined benefit pension liabilities.  \\n\\n \\n20 \\n \\nAs a result, the scheme is in a net liability position of £0.4 million (2023: net asset position of \\n£6.6 million), reflecting the largely-derisked position that it now benefits from. \\n \\nCash flow and capital structure \\n \\nThe net cash inflow from operating activities after lease payments in the year was £254.2 \\nmillion (2023: £257.1 million). The strength of cash generation reflected the growth in profits \\nand the sale of the legacy supply chain site in the year, offset by an increase in tax payments. \\nAt the end of the year the Group had net cash and cash equivalents of £125.3 million (2023: \\n£195.3 million). \\n \\nDuring the year we refinanced our revolving credit facility for a three-year period to June 2027, \\nwith two further one-year extension options. The facility provides liquidity of £100 million in \\ncommitted funds. Taking this into account, total available liquidity at the end of 2023 was \\n£225.3 million (2023: £265.3 million).  \\n \\nOur approach to capital allocation can be described as a series of priorities:  \\n \\n1.  Invest to adequately maintain the business in order to support its continued \\nsuccess. As noted above, in normal circumstances we expect maintenance capital \\nexpenditure to be up to 5% of revenue. \\n2.  Maintain a strong balance sheet. Reflecting the inherent gearing in the Group’s \\nleaseholds and working capital we aim, in normal circumstances, to maintain a \\nyear-end net cash position of circa 3% of revenue in order to allow for seasonality \\nin the working capital cycle and to protect the interests of all creditors.  \\n3.  Deliver an attractive ordinary dividend to shareholders. We continue to target a \\nprogressive ordinary dividend, normally around two times covered by underlying \\nprofit after taxation. \\n4.  Selectively invest to grow. As outlined above we intend to continue to make \\ncapital investments in excess of the maintenance level in the coming years to \\nsupport our growth plans. \\n5.  Return surplus cash to shareholders. Where net cash on the balance sheet \\nexceeds our minimum requirement, taking into account that reserved for growth \\ninvestments, we expect to return cash to shareholders by way of special dividends. \\n \\nThe Company’s current cash position will continue to normalise in 2025 and 2026 as we \\ncomplete the current investment phase to support our growth plans. \\n \\nLooking forward \\n \\nThe significant investments that we are making to support further profitable growth will create \\nshort-term ROCE and margin headwinds as we bring important new sites into our supply \\nchain.  However, this capacity will enable Greggs to realise the medium-term opportunity to \\ngrow its estate and expand into new channels, continuing the strategy that has been so \\nsuccessful in recent years.  Throughout this we will maintain a strong financial position and \\nthe discipline that has delivered profitable growth and excellent capital returns, to the benefit \\nof all of our stakeholders. \\n

Basis of preparation and accounting policies \\n \\nThe preliminary announcement has been prepared in accordance with international accounts \\nstandards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the \\nGroup accounts, UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.  It does not include all the \\ninformation required for full annual accounts. \\n \\nThe financial information set out above does not constitute the Company\\'s statutory accounts \\nfor the years ended 28 December 2024 or 30 December 2023 but is derived from these \\naccounts.  Statutory accounts for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2023 have been delivered \\nto the registrar of companies, and those for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2024 will be \\ndelivered in due course.  The auditor has reported on those accounts; the audit reports were \\n(i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention \\nby way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under \\nsection 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. \\n \\nThe preliminary announcement has been prepared using the accounting policies published in \\nthe Group’s accounts for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2023, which are available on the \\nCompany’s website www.greggs.co.uk.  From 1 January 2024 the following amendment was \\nadopted by the Group: \\n \\n• \\nNon-current Liabilities with Covenants – Amendments to IAS 1 and Classification of \\nLiabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1  \\n \\nIts adoption did not have a material effect on the accounts.   \\n \\nGoing concern \\n \\nThe Directors have considered the adoption of the going concern basis of preparation for these \\naccounts in the context of recent trading performance, macro-economic conditions and the \\ntrading outlook of the Group. At the end of the reporting period the Group had available liquidity \\ntotalling £225.3 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of £125.3 million plus an \\nundrawn revolving credit facility (“RCF”) of £100.0 million, which is committed to June 2027 \\nwith two further one-year extension options. The RCF includes financial covenants that the \\nGroup must comply with related to maximum leverage and a minimum fixed charge cover.  \\n \\nThe Directors have reviewed cash flow forecasts prepared for the period up to December 2026 \\nas well as covenant compliance for that period. In reviewing the cash flow forecasts the \\nDirectors considered the current trading performance of the Group and the likely capital \\nexpenditure and working capital requirements of its growth plans.  \\n \\nAfter reviewing these cash flow forecasts and making enquiries, the Directors are confident \\nthat the Company and the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their liabilities \\nas they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. Accordingly, \\nthey continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. \\n \\nJudgements and estimates \\n \\nIn preparing this preliminary announcement, management have made judgements and \\nestimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets \\nand liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.   \\n \\nImpairment (estimation) \\n \\n\\n \\n29 \\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment if events \\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For \\nexample, shop fittings and right-of-use assets may be impaired if sales in that shop fall. When \\na review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount is estimated based on the higher \\nof the value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs of disposal. Value-in-use calculations \\nare based on management’s estimates of future cash flows generated by the assets and an \\nappropriate discount rate. Consideration is also given to whether the impairment assessments \\nmade in prior years remain appropriate based on the latest expectations in respect of \\nrecoverable amounts. Where it is concluded that the impairment has reduced, a reversal of \\nthe impairment is recorded to the carrying value that would have been recognised if the original \\nimpairment had not occurred, net of depreciation that would have been charged. \\n \\nThe Group has traded profitably throughout 2024, growing volumes and increasing underlying \\nprofit before tax and exceptional items by 13.2% to £189.8 million. As such there is not \\nconsidered to be a global indicator of impairment across the Group’s asset base. Where \\nindicators of impairments exist for specific cash generating units (‘CGUs’), with each individual \\nshop considered its own CGU, then an impairment review has been performed to calculate \\nthe recoverable value.  \\n \\nFor those shops with indications of impairment, the value-in-use has been calculated using \\nthe following assumptions: \\n \\n• \\n LFL sales for shops with more than two years trade has been assumed to grow at \\na rate of 4.8% for year one of the period of the impairment review, reducing steadily \\nto 0.0% for year six onwards; \\n• \\n Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent (‘EBITDAR’) is \\nused as a proxy for net cash flow excluding rental payments; \\n• \\n The discount rate is based on the Group’s pre-tax cost of capital and at 28 \\nDecember 2024 was 10.0% (30 December 2023: 9.9%); and \\n• \\n Cash flows are forecast up to the probable end date of the lease. Where considered \\nappropriate, based on the estimated useful lives of fixtures and fittings within the \\nCGU, cash flows may be included for periods beyond the lease probable end date \\n(to a maximum of five years in total). \\n \\nOn the basis of these calculations, a net impairment charge of £5.0 million has been \\nrecognised during the current year (of which £2.9 million relates to fixtures and fittings and \\n£2.1 million relates to right-of-use assets) resulting in an impairment provision of £9.5 million \\nbeing retained at 28 December 2024 in respect of 109 shops (of which £4.6 million relates to \\nfixtures and fittings and £4.9 million relates to right-of-use assets).  \\n \\nGiven the uncertainties in the impairment model, the sensitivities of these assumptions on the \\nimpairment calculation have been tested: \\n \\n• \\n A 1% increase in the discount rate would result in an increased impairment of £0.6 \\nmillion, with an additional six shops impaired. A 1% decrease in the discount rate would \\nresult in a reduced impairment of £0.5 million, with ten fewer shops impaired.  \\n• \\n A 5% increase in the starting LFL assumption would result in a reduced impairment of \\n£2.4 million with 26 fewer shops impaired. A 5% decrease in the LFL assumption \\nwould result in an increased provision of £3.7 million with an additional 42 shops \\nimpaired.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n30 \\n \\n \\nDetermining the rate used to discount lease payments (judgement) \\n \\nAt the commencement date of property leases the lease liability is calculated by discounting the \\nlease payments. The discount rate used should be the interest rate implicit in the lease. However, \\nif that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for property leases, the \\nlessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have \\nto pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset \\nin a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. As the Group had \\nno suitable external borrowings from which to determine that rate, judgement is required to \\ndetermine the incremental borrowing rate to be used. At the start of each month a risk-free rate is \\nobtained, linked to the length of the lease and an adjustment is then made to reflect credit risk. \\nDuring the year discount rates in the range 5.1% to 6.1% (2023: 4.42% to 6.83%) were used. \\nSmall changes in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on the accounts. A 0.1% \\nchange in the discount rate used for each lease is estimated to adjust the total liabilities by circa \\n£2 million. \\n \\nDetermining the lease term of property leases (judgement) \\n \\nAt the commencement date of property leases, and based on previous experience, the Group \\nnormally determines the lease term to be the full term of the lease, assuming that any option to \\nbreak or extend the lease is unlikely to be exercised and it is not reasonably certain that the Group \\nwill continue in occupation for any period beyond the lease term. Leases are regularly reviewed \\nand will be revalued if it becomes reasonably certain, as a result of trading performance and/or \\nfurther investment in the property, that a break clause or option to extend the lease will be \\nexercised. \\n \\nThe leases typically run for a period of 10 or 15 years. In England and Wales, the majority of the \\nGroup’s property leases are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (‘LTA’) which affords \\nprotection to the lessee at the end of an existing lease term.  \\n \\nJudgement is required in respect of those property leases where the current lease term has \\nexpired but the Group has not yet renewed the lease. Where the Group believes renewal to be \\nreasonably certain and the lease is protected by the LTA it will be treated as having been renewed \\nat the date of termination of the previous lease term and on the same terms as the previous lease. \\nWhere renewal is not considered to be reasonably certain the leases are included with a lease \\nterm which reflects the anticipated notice period under relevant legislation. The lease will be \\nrevalued when it is renewed to take account of the new terms. As at 28 December 2024 the \\nfinancial effect of applying this judgement was an increase in recognised lease liabilities of \\n£27.0 million (30 December 2023: £36.0 million). \\n \\nPost-retirement benefits – defined benefit obligation (estimation) \\n \\nThe determination of the defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme \\ndepends on the selection of certain assumptions with significant estimation uncertainty including \\nthe discount rate, inflation rate, mortality rates and commutation. Differences arising from actual \\nexperience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future years.  \\n \\nPost-retirement benefits – accounting for purchase of buy-in policy (judgement) \\n \\nIn 2024 the Company made a special contribution of £4.5 million to its defined benefit pension \\nscheme which helped facilitate the purchase of a ‘buy-in’ bulk annuity policy with Aviva. This policy \\nprovides regular payments to the scheme to fund pension payments and significantly reduces the \\nCompany\\'s exposure to the funding risks associated with its defined benefit pension liabilities. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n31 \\n \\nThe valuation of the assets held by the scheme following the buy-in results in an accounting loss \\nwhich has been recognised in other comprehensive income. Although a buy-out of the scheme is \\npossible in the future there is no indication that this will be executed and finalised in the short-term. \\nThe scheme has retained all responsibility to meet future pension payments to pensioners and \\nthe buy-in is therefore not recognised as a settlement.  \\n \\nIn accordance with IAS19 the assets and liabilities of the Scheme remain on the Company balance \\nsheet and the loss associated with the Pension Buy In and other actuarial movements in the year \\nended 28 December 2024 have been recognised through other comprehensive income. \\n \\n2. Segmental analysis \\n \\nThe Executive Directors are considered to be the ‘chief operating decision maker’ of the Group \\nin the context of the IFRS 8 definition. In addition to its company-managed retail activities, the \\nGroup generates revenues from its business-to-business channel which includes franchise \\nand wholesale activities. Both channels were categorised as reportable segments for the \\npurposes of IFRS 8. \\n \\nCompany-managed retail activities – the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, \\nsandwiches and drinks in its own shops or via delivery. Sales are made to the general public \\non a cash basis. All results arise in the UK. \\n \\nBusiness-to-business channel – the Group sells products to franchise and wholesale partners \\nfor sale in their own outlets as well as charging a licence fee to franchise partners. These sales \\nand fees are invoiced to the partners on a credit basis.

Related parties \\n \\nThe Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, associates, Directors and \\nexecutive officers and pension schemes. \\n \\nThere have been no related party transactions in the year which have materially affected the \\nfinancial position or performance of the Group.  \\n \\n8. Principal risks and uncertainties \\n \\nOur risk management process is well-established, though it continues to evolve and develop. \\nWe have an enterprise-wide risk management policy and framework in place, both of which \\nhave been approved by the Board. This provides us with a robust structure and drives a \\nconsistent approach.   \\n \\nOur risk process works ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’. Risks are identified by considering potential \\nevents which could prevent the achievement of our objectives.   \\n \\nThe Operating Board is responsible for maintaining the overall corporate risk register, which \\ndocuments the key risks to the business. We conduct a formal review of our key strategic risks \\ntwice a year via the Risk Committee, with input from each of the risk owners who have an \\nopportunity to highlight any changes. This allows us to discuss the risk gradings, and ensure \\nthat the level of risk remains within the tolerance of our risk appetite.  The Risk Committee \\n\\n \\n36 \\n \\nalso considers new risks escalated to it at every meeting, and assesses whether or not these \\nare significant enough to merit inclusion on the strategic risk register . \\n \\nEach of our Heads of Business Functions is responsible for their own risk register, which is \\nproduced in the same manner and format as our corporate register. Functional risk registers \\nare reviewed at least annually. Where a functional risk is considered \\nto be sufficiently significant that it could impact on the wider business, it is escalated to the \\nRisk Committee for further consideration, and appropriate action.   \\n \\nThe risk process is facilitated by members of the Business Assurance Team, who help to \\nidentify and assess key risks, as well as providing support in developing an appropriate risk \\nresponse. In addition, the team provides an independent view on the controls in place over \\nspecific risk areas within the internal audit plan.  \\n \\nOur risk registers capture a description of each risk, and an Operating Board member or a \\nHead of Business Function is allocated as risk owner. Each risk owner is responsible for \\nensuring that appropriate mitigating controls are in place, as well as identifying actions to \\nfurther enhance controls where necessary. We record the key controls for each risk, and make \\nan assessment of their effectiveness. The likelihood and impact of each risk arising is then \\ncalculated, both before and after the introduction of mitigating controls. \\n \\nDevelopments in 2024 \\n \\nWe have reviewed and refocused our Risk Committee agenda to allow more time for \\ndiscussion and ‘deep-dive’ topics. A rolling annual agenda ensures that matters such as policy \\napprovals and process reviews are completed when required.   \\n \\nTo improve our communication of risk, we have developed a ‘risk dashboard’, which provides \\na monthly summary of key issues to the Operating Board, and is drawn up in conjunction with \\nother core functions.   \\n \\nDuring the year, we completed a fraud risk review in conjunction with an external consultant, \\nwho provided guidance on the process. Fraud risks were identified and recorded via \\nworkshops attended by the Operating Board and a range of subject matter experts from across \\nthe business. Findings were presented back to the Risk Committee for sign-off, and the results \\nhave been incorporated into our risk register. This improves our visibility of fraud risk and the \\neffectiveness of associated controls.   \\n \\nWe have worked with our insurance broker to assess our risk appetite, in line with best \\npractice, to promote consistency in our approach, and to guide colleagues on acceptable risk \\nlevels. Wenow have ten categories of risk rather than the four previously in use to give greater \\ngranularity of the appetite assessment. Our risk appetite is low for all of our categories, driven \\nby a strong commitment to safety, compliance and long-term sustainability.   \\n \\nWe have continued to engage with the Heads of Business functions, and as noted above, we \\nhave fully rolled out our risk registers to a functional level. As part of our regular six-monthly \\nreview with risk owners, we have reviewed risk and control descriptions to make sure they \\nremain relevant and accurate.  Risk registers have also been compiled for each of our Greggs \\nPledge commitments. \\n \\nMaterial controls \\n \\nWe have reviewed our risk and internal control framework to establish which elements should \\nbe considered ‘material controls’ and therefore require inclusion in our assurance framework \\nsupporting the new UK Corporate Governance Code requirements in due course.   \\n \\nFirstly, we considered all of our strategic and principal risks to establish whether they would \\ncause the business to fail, should they materialise (our ‘material risks’). For this list of risks, \\n\\n \\n37 \\n \\nwe then reviewed the associated controls to determine which of those are material (i.e. they \\nwould have a significant effect in reducing the impact of the risk, should it materialise). This \\nreview has been carried out by small working groups of subject matter experts, then sense \\nchecked by the Risk Committee who independently gave a view on material risks and controls.   \\n \\nDiscussions are ongoing, and we will continue to refine our approach. Our view on material \\ncontrols will evolve during 2025 as we evaluate our position. We will engage with the Audit \\nCommittee regularly during the coming year.   \\n \\nFor any material controls, we will identify and document our assurance sources. Where such \\nassurance is to be sourced internally, we will ensure that appropriate processes are in place \\nto obtain it in a robust and timely manner. \\n \\nClimate risks \\n \\nOur climate-related risks are captured in a consistent manner to all other risks, and are \\nrecorded within our strategic and functional registers. Members of our Business Assurance \\nTeam participate in our Sustainability Reporting Steering Group to ensure risks and \\nopportunities are considered and recorded.  \\n \\nWe remain of the view that our strategic risk of ‘a failure to respond effectively to climate-\\nrelated impacts on our business’ does not constitute a principal risk within the time horizon of \\nour current plans. \\n \\nEmerging risks \\n \\nWe conduct an emerging risk review on a quarterly basis as part of our Risk Committee’s \\nrolling agenda. This helps to anticipate change and respond proactively. Various sources of \\ninformation are used to ensure this is as complete as possible, including: \\n \\n• \\nhorizon scanning by subject matter experts throughout the business, with issues \\nidentified being escalated to our Operating Board via a monthly risk dashboard;  \\n• \\nengaging with our functional heads to discuss any areas of concern within their remit; \\n• \\nmonitoring customer and consumer trends; and  \\n• \\ntaking input from our advisers and other specialists with whom we work.   \\n \\nCurrent areas of emerging and escalating risks which we are monitoring include geopolitical \\nuncertainty, market pressures and consumer demand across the sector. We are undergoing \\na significant systems upgrade project, which is also being closely monitored as an emerging \\nrisk.  Emerging risks are reported to the Main Board each quarter. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n38 \\n \\n \\nChanges to principal risk disclosures \\n \\nA principal risk is a risk or combination of risks that can seriously affect our performance, future \\nprospects or reputation.  Not all of our strategic risks are considered to be principal risks, only \\nthose which would have a significant impact on our ongoing viability within the timeframe of \\nour strategic plan. \\n \\nThere have been no significant changes to our principal risks during 2024.   \\n \\nThe following table sets out the principal risks, shows the movement during the year, and \\ndescribes the impact and key mitigations.  The list is not in priority order, and does not include \\nall the risks which are faced by the business.  Other risks which are not included here could \\nalso have a negative impact on the business, including those which are not presently known \\nto us.
